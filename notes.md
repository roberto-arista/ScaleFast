Developer Notes
===============

The ScaleFast extension contains code from two external modules:

- [dynamicParameters](http://github.com/roboDocs/dynamicParameters)
- [mutatorScale](http://github.com/roboDocs/MutatorScale)

These modules are included in ScaleFast using `git subtree`.

See [Git Subtree Merge](http://johnatten.com/2013/03/16/git-subtree-merge-the-quick-version/) for reference.
